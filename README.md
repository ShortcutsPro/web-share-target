# Web Share Target API

**Date**: 2016-06-08

This site details a proposal to add a capability for websites to receive shared
data from other sites and apps.

* [Explainer document](docs/explainer.md), a high-level overview of the proposal.
* [Interface document](docs/interface.md), an informal spec.
* [Native integration survey](docs/native.md), for platform-specific matters.

This is a product of the [Ballista project](../README.md), which aims to explore
website-to-website and website-to-native interoperability.
